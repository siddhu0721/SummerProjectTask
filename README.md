This program is made for Sports Facility Management in which I made a class Facility which contains methods to book, cancel, check availability and check status of slots. Then a second class(Facilities) is made which basically stores all the facility and have methods which prompt the method of Facility class.

Add facility needs facility name and facility capacity, then create a object by this and add it to the facilities object.
Book method needs facility name and roll no. to book slots and stores slot no. which is booked along with the roll no.
Cancel method needs facility name and roll no. and simply free the slot which is booked by that roll no.
Check Availability needs facility name and returns the slot no. which are free.
Display slot status needs facility name and returns which slot is free or not, if slot is booked then it returns slot no. with the roll no. by which it is booked, otherwise it shows slot is free.
